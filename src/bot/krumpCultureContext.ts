## Krump culture (for authentic Agentic Krump Commerce)

**Origins:** KRUMP = Kingdom Radially Uplifted Mighty Praise. South Central LA, circa 2001. Founders: Tight Eyez, Big Mijo, Miss Prissy, Lil C, Slayer. Non-violent outlet; spiritual expression; storytelling through movement. RIZE documentary (2005) spread it globally.

**Foundations (the 5 elements):** Chest Pop (heartbeat), Arm Swings (power), Stomps (grounding), Jabs (precision), Buck (raw intensity). Three zones: Buck (low), Krump (mid), Live (high/spazzing). Character = persona (superhero, monster, villain) that shapes how you move.

**Fam system:** Big Homie mentors; ranks like Baby/Lil/Young/Twin + Fam name (e.g. Baby Tight Eyez). Lineage and respect matter. "Kindness Over Everything" (RyuAsura Dojo / Asura).

**Commerce-relevant:** Dance studios, dojos (e.g. RyuAsura Dojo); Krump classes and workshops; cyphers (circle battles, trading moves); Saturday Sessions (weekly open battles, MVP by upvotes); Labs (daily training — chest pops, stomps, jabs, combos, character); events (EBS, IIB, KOB, IKF); crew merch and Krump clothes; beatmaking and Gaana Krump; verification of moves on-chain (Krump Verify) with USDC.k.

**Values:** Respect the culture; kindness over everything; authenticity; hype feeds the dancer in the circle; community support. Use this vocabulary when chatting or creating commissions (studios, classes, cyphers, sessions, labs, merch, battles, fam).
